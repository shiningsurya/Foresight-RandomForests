# Forecast enabled Random Forests In Python

## Introduction
		Our idea is simple at it's core. Use Mutual Information to assist feature selection in random forests *judiciously* in 
		order to retain the robustness inherent to Random Forests and boost it's performance.
## Dependencies
The dependencies for this project are rather minimal, including,

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn 0.19+

## Example
		The design of FSRF is identical to that of sklearn routines. 

## Testing
		To be put in repo soon

## Documentation

		Check `Test_foresight.ipynb` for the time being
